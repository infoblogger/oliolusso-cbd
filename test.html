<h1 style="text-align: center;">Cannabinoids Alleviate Symptoms of Bruxism</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bruxism or Tooth Grinding is a mouth-related disease in which your teeth clench or grind with each other. In Bruxism, your top and bottom teeth are tightly held with each other or you can simply say they slide back and forth over each other. It looks like a simple disease but it can cause severe impact if it is not treated in earlier stages. Bruxism can even cause Prostate Cancer when it remains for a long time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The use of Cannabinoids can alleviate the symptoms of Bruxism. There is a complete mechanism behind this alleviation but first of we should have the basic knowledge about the causes, symptoms, and risk factors of Bruxism.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: justify;">Causes, symptoms, and risk factors of Bruxism</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People can have bruxism without being aware and they clench and grind teeth at any time of day or night. Some people have Bruxism is sleep. It is the worst kind of Bruxism because you can't control it in sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a very wide range of causes of Bruxism but medical officials are agreed on stress. Stress is the basic and most common reason for Bruxism. Stress can easily trigger the Bruxism in many people. Some people have Bruxism even without any causes. For example, people start clenching their teeth just sitting in loneliness. Bruxism causes pain also in some cases.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Doctors have agreed that Bruxism is a habit rather than normal reflex chewing activity. Regular chewing activity is always in response to some stimulus. For example, if you have food in your mouth, you will start chewing it but in the case of Bruxism, you will start clenching your teeth without any stimulus. Bruxism is a neuromuscular activity that can be controlled consciously, but Bruxism in sleep cannot be controlled very easily.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from stress, Bruxism has the following possible causes,</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Disturbed sleep</li>
<li>Malocclusion</li>
<li>High consumption of Caffeinated drinks such as coffee and colas</li>
<li>High consumption of Alcohol</li>
<li>Smoking</li>
<li>Anxiety and depression</li>
<li>Hypersensitivity of dopamine receptors in the brain</li>
<li>Parkinson&rsquo;s disease</li>
<li>Obsessive-compulsive disorder</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, we will discuss the symptoms of Bruxism. Bruxism has the following common symptoms.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Anxiety</li>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;">How Cannabinoids alleviates symptoms of Bruxism?</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cannabinoids have the ability to alleviate symptoms of Bruxism. CBD is the best cannabinoid for this purpose. CBD is the abbreviation of Cannabidiol. It is the chemical extract of the hemp (Cannabis) plant. CBD has anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties which are very helpful in the treatment of the symptoms of Bruxism. We will discuss the separate treatment of Bruxism symptoms by CBD.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&uuml; CBD can relieve the pain of jaws in Bruxism:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pain in jaws is a big problem in Bruxism. You can't do anything with this pain and you want it to eradicate quickly. CBD is a natural pain-reliever. Just apply it to your jaws and you will start feeling comfortable in a matter of time. CBD is not psychoactive and toxic at all, so you can take it without the fear of overdose. Inflammation is another big cause of pain in jaws. CBD reduces inflammation and hence you can relieve the pain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CBD relieves pain and inflammation by interacting with the body's endocannabinoid system (ECS) and regulating the secretion of Cytokines. Cytokines are the chemical responsible for inflammation.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&uuml; CBD can reduce anxiety, depression, and stress:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anxiety, depression, and stress are the main symptoms of Bruxism. Recent studies have reported that CBD might be very helpful in reducing anxiety and depression and hence relives you in Bruxism. CBD improves your focus and keep your brain healthy and fresh. You can control the Bruxism consciously by using CBD.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&uuml; CBD in the treatment of Insomnia:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Insomnia is characterized as sleeplessness and disturbed sleep patterns. It is another main symptom of Bruxism. Research studies have reported that CBD might be very helpful in improving sleep and hence in the treatment of Insomnia. CBD can treat the factors causing Insomnia such as depression and stress and hence aid in the treatment of Bruxism.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&uuml; CBD helps with Hangover:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hangover is the foggy state of mind in the high consumption of alcohol. As we have discussed earlier, high alcohol consumption is a cause of Bruxism, CBD oil might be very helpful in reducing the effects of high consumption of alcohol.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&uuml; CBD helps you awake at the right time to control Bruxism:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we have described earlier, Bruxism in sleep is the most difficult condition to treat because you can't focus on your CNS (Central Nervous System) and Neuromuscular system to control it. CBD helps you awake at the right time when you are clenching your teeth. So, you can stop Bruxism easily while awaking at the right time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You are probably thinking that how can CBD oil help you awake at the time of Bruxism? Well, CBD is simply organized and improves your sleep patterns. If you are using CBD, you will awake automatically on a slight disturbance in your sleep</p>
